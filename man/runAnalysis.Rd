\title{Run a JASP analysis in R.}
\usage{
runAnalysis(
  name,
  dataset,
  options,
  view = TRUE,
  quiet = FALSE,
  makeTests = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{name}{String indicating the name of the analysis to run. This name is
identical to that of the main function in a JASP analysis.}

\item{dataset}{Data.frame, matrix, string name or string path; if it's a string then jaspTools
first checks if it's valid path and if it isn't if the string matches one of the JASP datasets (e.g., "debug.csv").
By default the directory in Resources is checked first, unless called within a testthat environment, in which case tests/datasets is checked first.}

\item{options}{List of options to supply to the analysis (see also
\code{analysisOptions}).}

\item{view}{Boolean indicating whether to view the results in a webbrowser.}

\item{quiet}{Boolean indicating whether to suppress messages from the
analysis.}

\item{makeTests}{Boolean indicating whether to create testthat unit tests and print them to the terminal.}
}
\description{
\code{runAnalysis} makes it possible to execute a JASP analysis in R. Usually this
process is a bit cumbersome as there are a number of objects unique to the
JASP environment. Think .ppi, data-reading, etc. These (rcpp) objects are
replaced in the jaspTools so you do not have to deal with them. Note that
\code{runAnalysis} sources JASP analyses every time it runs, so any change in
analysis code between calls is incorporated. The output of the analysis is
shown automatically through a call to \code{view} and returned
invisibly.

options <- analysisOptions("BinomialTest")
options[["variables"]] <- "contBinom"
runAnalysis("BinomialTest", "debug", options)

# Above and below are identical (below is taken from the Qt terminal)
